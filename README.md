* The goal was to create an easy to understand, simple Vagrant config to adapt to your own needs. Anyway there are very good projects about this topic like malboxes, etc, but these involve a lot of other tools and are hard to understand and change for your usecase. This is a good place to start and expand if needed.

##Installation and Requirements
* you will need Vagrant and Virtual Box
* clone the Repository to your directory
* you might want to add your own provisioning script to setup the Linux boxes. (For the lazy: https://github.com/akshaymankar/copy_my_conf )
* 'vagrant up' ;)
* for Windows Guests you need WinRM enabled and Vagrant ready boxes in /boxes

## ToDo
* add option to connect Windows Boxes to Kali only
* probably create own Box templates for more security (who trusts people from the interwebs?)
